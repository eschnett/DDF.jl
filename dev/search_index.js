The domain is decomposed into simplices, and the function is represented via a basis in each simplex. This is a form of a Finite Element discretization. For example, a scalar function in two dimensions might be represented via its values at the vertices. In between the vertices it might be defined via linear interpolation.","category":"page"},{"location":"index.html","page":"DDF.jl: Discrete Differential Forms","title":"DDF.jl: Discrete Differential Forms","text":"The DDF package is based on FEEC, the Finite Element Exterior Calculus.
